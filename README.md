## Installation Instructions

First, get firefly running on your machine. [Getting Started guide](https://hyperledger.github.io/firefly/latest/gettingstarted/).

Once you have that up and running, look at `solidity`, `backend`, and `frontend` directories to see their respective README's for installation and setup. For ease of use, I have them linked below:
